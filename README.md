# Fast-API-exercise
React Native app with FastAPI backend for searching Discogs artists.
This repository contains an exercise focused on developing a mobile application using React Native that communicates with a FastAPI backend.

The goal of the exercise is to create a mobile application capable of searching artists from the Discogs artist list utilizing the Discogs API (accessible at https://www.discogs.com/developers). The application should display lists of artists, including their names and pictures. It features a search bar allowing users to input search queries, which are then sent to the backend API to retrieve relevant data.

The FastAPI backend is responsible for interfacing with the Discogs API to fetch artist data, which is subsequently stored locally for efficient retrieval.

Key Features:

Utilizes React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
Implements a FastAPI backend to facilitate communication with the Discogs API.
Enables users to search for artists and retrieve relevant data.
Displays lists of artists along with their names and pictures.
